                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    After 12 years in sales I've made the decision to change my career path. <br>
                    I'm currently studying webdevelopment with the ambition become a fullstack
                    developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I set my mind into accomplishing something - whatever it might be,
                    I won't stop until I've reached my goal. <br>
                    Some people said it would be impossible to work fulltime, being a single parent and
                    study wedev. at full speed - all at the same time. Let me start by showing you right
                    now that it is all possible.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing I started to plan was how to write my html code 
                    in a way so that I could use flexbox in order to make my resumé 
                    responsive <br><br>
                    Since I wanted a layout where the page divided into two halfs
                    I started with creating a div which would act as the main container. <br>
                    After that I created two additional divs who then would act as the right and left side.
                    <br><br>
                    After that I created two more divs nested inside the 2nd divs. The reason
                    for this was because I wanted to create two "cards" in order to highlight 
                    the content. To make it a bit more pretty I added some box-shadow, background-color
                    and padding.
                    <br><br>
                    So the main-container then gets the display of flex and the standard direction of row
                    since I wanted a two-sided layout.
                    <br><br>
                    The nested div/flexbox then got the flex-direction of column since
                    I want them stacked vertically.
                    <br>
                    However I used mediaquery to change the display of the of the entire page to 
                    having a flex-direction of column (stacked vertically) if you are looking at 
                    an ipad or a mobile phone.
                </p>
                <h2>About the CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    So the first thing I did was to select a background-image, which i found at <a href="https://unsplash.com/" class="imageLink">unsplash.com</a>.
                    After that I selected a few fonts att fonts.google which I then linked in to my html and css.
                    <br><br>
                    The next step was to create my first box and make it responsive through flexbox. 
                    <br>
                    Then it was kind of rinse and repeat for the rest of the boxes. I did some minor adjustments
                    with some padding and margins in order to make the page a bit more pretty. 
                    <br><br>
                    I also chose to keep the list-type-style as default for some of the unordered lists 
                    since i wanted to keep the bullet-points for my previous experiences etc.
                    <br><br>
                    All in all I think the first module where we learned about basic html, css and most of all
                    flexbox has been very interesting. It feels great to have taken the first steps!
